Lan Wang Ji was born in the prominent Sect of the Gusu Lan. Due to his great achievements and reputation, he gained the title Hanguang-Jun, which means the light holder. He was seen as a hero, the role model of everyone in the cultivation world and is known to appear wherever chaos is. While Wei Wu Xian, the Yiling Patriarch, was a name that was feared by everyone. He has done many heroic things in his life, but also really cruel ones, such as killing thousands of people and even causing the death of those who saw him as family. In the end, Wei Wu Xian was \"killed\", after he became too evil for the world to exist, by his best friend and only survivor of the Yunmeng Jiang Sect, Jiang Cheng, who was once like a brother to him. At least that is what the legend says. Sixteen years after his so-called \"death\", Wei Wu Xian suddenly reappeared again at the Mo Village. Between the boundary of good and evil, was Wei Wu Xian really as evil as the legend says and was Lan Wang Ji really that righteous as people claim him to be? And how much of the legend is actually true?</p>",

Although at first they do not like each other, from the first day they decide to get together to get work in whatever they can. One day we will see them as microbuseros, another will rent out Chamberlains, risk hiring as two funny clowns, without planning to become actors, fighters, tourist guide and even two naive illegal who believe they reach the United States. From day one, V\u00edtor and Albertano will have to \"endure\" with their differences in tastes and ways of seeing life, which will make the series one of the favorites of the public.</p>",

        "summary": "<p><b>Nosotros los Guapos </b>is a Mexican television series produced by Guillermo del Bosque for Televisa by the chain platform Blim and Las Estrellas. V\u00edtor and Albertano pursue the same objective, to obtain a place where to live and, very to their regret, to look for a work that allows them to survive and to pay the rent of the room that both decide to share at Do\u00f1a Cuca's house. Since they are found, various stories are intertwined that will come to life in each chapter, where by \"forced coincidences of life\", El V\u00edtor and Albertano will go through funny, unexpected and gossipy situations that will test their budding friendship. Although at first they do not like each other, from the first day they decide to get together to get work in whatever they can. One day we will see them as microbuseros, another will rent out Chamberlains, risk hiring as two funny clowns, without planning to become actors, fighters, tourist guide and even two naive illegal who believe they reach the United States. From day one, V\u00edtor and Albertano will have to \"endure\" with their differences in tastes and ways of seeing life, which will make the series one of the favorites of the public.</p>",

May it be one's walked distance or amount of compliments given to them by others, this Count could lead them to the abyss when it has dropped to zero.<br /><br />In the year 305 of the Alcian calendar, Hina has inherited a mission from her Mother, whose Count has depreciated to zero, to search for the Legendary Red Baron. In her adventure, she meets a half-masked swordsman named Licht who tries to hide his identity, as he is known as a degenerate for having an incredibly low Count.</p>",
