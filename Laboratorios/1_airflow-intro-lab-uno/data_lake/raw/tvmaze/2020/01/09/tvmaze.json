Lan Wang Ji was born in the prominent Sect of the Gusu Lan. Due to his great achievements and reputation, he gained the title Hanguang-Jun, which means the light holder. He was seen as a hero, the role model of everyone in the cultivation world and is known to appear wherever chaos is. While Wei Wu Xian, the Yiling Patriarch, was a name that was feared by everyone. He has done many heroic things in his life, but also really cruel ones, such as killing thousands of people and even causing the death of those who saw him as family. In the end, Wei Wu Xian was \"killed\", after he became too evil for the world to exist, by his best friend and only survivor of the Yunmeng Jiang Sect, Jiang Cheng, who was once like a brother to him. At least that is what the legend says. Sixteen years after his so-called \"death\", Wei Wu Xian suddenly reappeared again at the Mo Village. Between the boundary of good and evil, was Wei Wu Xian really as evil as the legend says and was Lan Wang Ji really that righteous as people claim him to be? And how much of the legend is actually true?</p>",

Now, with a new government in power, Chile is finally ready to end Colonia's violent legacy. Young federal prosecutor Leo Ram\u00edrez is tasked with bringing the sect's elusive leader Paul Schaefer to justice. But Leo has his own secret history with Colonia. 20 years ago, his younger brother Pedro died there under mysterious circumstances, and it was Schaefer himself who paid for Leo's education in Germany to keep him quiet.</p><p>Now Leo is determined to tear the walls of Colonia down once and for all \u2013 but when a young man claiming to be Pedro suddenly turns up alive, Leo must finally confront the demons that tore his family apart all those years ago.</p>",

Nobody knows where he came from, but he has obviously missed the last 100 years of human progress and explores modern locations with boundless energy and enthusiasm. His awkward movements, combined with a strong desire to learn more about the world around him, often have hilarious results! However, this doesn't satisfy Booba's curiosity, so his adventures will continue in the upcoming series.</p>",
